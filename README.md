# rc5-rust
A simple RC5 cipher implementation in Rust.
Rivest describes the rc5 cipher here https://www.grc.com/r&d/rc5.pdf and includes a c reference implementation.
The goal of this code is to implement rc5 in Rust, in a clean, extendible code.

> Originally a cryptography base recruitment test made for MintLayer. Original repo: https://github.com/rimbi/rc5_test
